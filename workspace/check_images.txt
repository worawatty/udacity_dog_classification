Questions regarding Uploaded Image Classification:

1. Did the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Pug_01.jpg to be the same breed? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: Yes, all the three models classified the image as 'pug, pug-dog'


2. Did each of the three model architectures classify the breed of dog in Dog_01.jpg to be the same breed of dog as that model architecture classified Dog_02.jpg? If not, report the differences in the classifications.

Answer: No, here are the diffrences:
    RESNET  Pug_01.jpg  classified as   pug, pug-dog
            Pug_02.jpg  classified as   pug, pug-dog
    ALEXNET Pug_01.jpg  classified as   pug, pug-dog
            Pug_02.jpg  classified as   ant, emmet, pismire
    VGG     Pug_01.jpg  classified as   pug, pug-dog
            Pug_02.jpg  classified as   llama


3. Did the three model architectures correctly classify Animal_Name_01.jpg and Object_Name_01.jpg to not be dogs? If not, report the misclassifications.

Answer: Yes, all three model architectures correctly classified NOT-Dog images.


4. Based upon your answers for questions 1. - 3. above, select the model architecture that you feel did the best at classifying the four uploaded images. Describe why you selected that model architecture as the best on uploaded image classification.

Answer: The following is a brief summary of the results:

Model Arch.         % Not-a-Dog     % Dogs Correct     % Breed Correct      % Match Labels
ResNET                  100             100                 100                 50
VGG                     100             50                  50                  25
ALEXNET                 100             50                  50                  25

From the table above, we can see that all model architecture correcly classified the not-dog images (Cat_01.jpg and Table_01.jpg)
However both VGG and Alexnet suffer when classifying dog images, especially, Pog_02 image, which is the 180 degree rotated image of Pog_01.jpg.
Another observation is even though ResNET perform well in all stats but only achieve 50% on the match label stat,
this was due to the fact that both it misclassified the true label of the non-dog images. Thus, it may be able to tell the different between dog and non-dog images, but may not be good enough to classify the actual labels.

In conclusion, the model with the best classification would be ResNet.
